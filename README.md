# Entry for Bird Audio Detection Challenge

For more information about the challenge, see the [project
website](http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/)
or the [paper that summarizes the
challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03417).

# Status

- This is a codebase that I used for EEG processing, but many of the same elements can be used.

# Contributing

If you are new to git and github, I encourage you to read this [guide to
contributing](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/11/howto-contribute-to-open-source-project-on-github/).
Basically, read through the issues and/or talk to the team leaders to
see what would be a useful contribution. Then, you can either: 

- fork the repo (please keep it private for now), write your code,
    verify that it works, and submit a pull request into master when it is ready
- create a branch 'feature/*' and submit a pull request into master
    when you are ready
